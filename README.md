# CachedAsyncImage-SwiftUI
SwiftUI provides clean `AsyncImage` facility to download an asynchronous image and showing placeholder during image download. But the SwiftUI library does not cache the image, which results in redownloading the image each time. This repo provides a cleaner solution written over the AsyncImage library to support the caching facility.
